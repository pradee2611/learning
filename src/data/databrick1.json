    "question": "A Generative AI Engineer is responsible for developing a chatbot to enable their company's internal HelpDesk Call Center team to more quickly find related tickets and provide resolution. While creating the GenAI application work breakdown tasks for this project, they realize they need to start planning which data sources (either Unity Catalog volume or Delta table) they could choose for this application. They have collected several candidate data sources for consideration: call_rep_history: a Delta table with primary keys representative_id, call_id. This table is maintained to calculate representatives' call resolution from fields call_duration and call start_time. transcript Volume: a Unity Catalog Volume of all recordings as a *.way files, but also a text transcript as *.txt files. call_cust_history: a Delta table with primary keys customer_id, cal1_id. This table is maintained to calculate how much internal customers use the HelpDesk to make sure that the charge back model is consistent with actual service use. call_detail: a Delta table that includes a snapshot of all call details updated hourly. It includes root_cause and resolution fields, but those fields may be empty for calls that are still active. maintenance_schedule – a Delta table that includes a listing of both HelpDesk application outages as well as planned upcoming maintenance downtimes. They need sources that could add context to best identify ticket root cause and resolution. Which TWO sources do that? (Choose two.)",
